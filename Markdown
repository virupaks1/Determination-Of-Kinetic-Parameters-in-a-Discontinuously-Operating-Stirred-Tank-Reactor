A computational toolkit for determining kinetic parameters in chemical reactions from experimental batch reactor data. Developed for analyzing hydrolysis of acetic anhydride, but adaptable to other reactions.

## Key Features 🔑

- 🧬 Three analysis methods implemented:
  - Autocatalytic approach
  - Power law with variable reaction orders (α = 0.8-1.2)
  - Arrhenius equation modeling
- 📊 Automated R² calculation for model comparison
- 🔥 Activation energy (Eₐ) and pre-exponential factor (k₀) determination
- 📈 Built-in visualization for concentration-time profiles and Arrhenius plots
- 🔍 Optimal reaction order identification

## Installation 📦

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
